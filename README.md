# 🛵 MERN Stack Delivery App (MVP)

This is a minimal viable product (MVP) for a Delivery App built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**. The app was developed as part of a self-learning challenge using the **Vibe Coding** course with coding assistance from **ChatGPT**.

## ✨ Features

- 🚚 Place and track delivery orders
- 📍 Location-based order updates
- 👤 Simple authentication (Login/Register)
- 🧾 Order history and status tracking
- 💻 Responsive frontend using React and Tailwind CSS
- 🔐 Backend built with Node.js and Express
- 🗄️ MongoDB database with Mongoose for data modeling

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Axios
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **Other Tools:** ChatGPT (for code generation & debugging), Postman (API testing), Git

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm
- MongoDB running locally or MongoDB Atlas

### Installation
